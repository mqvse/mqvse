### 🌿 Hi, I'm Lina.

I’m a **Frontend Developer & UI Specialist** who turns complex logic into clean, accessible digital experiences. I bridge the gap between data and design, building interfaces that feel as good as they function.

* 🌱 **My Philosophy:** I treat UI like a living product. Accessibility, responsiveness, and clean component architecture get the same rigor as backend logic. I challenge clutter and hunt for the simple design beneath the complexity.
* 🍃 **The Toolkit:** I build with **React** and **JavaScript**, while keeping my data roots strong with **Python (Pandas)** and **SQL**. I believe in "Code as Craft"—meticulous, scalable, and built to last.
* 🌵 **Beyond the Code:** When I'm not in VS Code, I'm usually **rock climbing**, **baking** something complicated, or working on a new **crochet** project. I love applying the patience of textile arts to the discipline of coding.
