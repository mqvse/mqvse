### 🌿 Hi, I'm Lina.

I’m a **Junior Frontend Developer** with a Computer Science background, focused on building clean, responsive, and accessible web interfaces using React and JavaScript.

I enjoy turning complex requirements into simple UI flows, with an emphasis on usability, component structure, and maintainable code.

🌱 **What I care about**
- Building responsive, accessible interfaces
- Clean component architecture
- Writing frontend code that’s easy to extend and reason about

🍃 **Outside of coding**
When I’m not in VS Code, I’m usually rock climbing, baking, or working on a crochet project. I like building things slowly and properly, whether that’s yarn or JavaScript.
